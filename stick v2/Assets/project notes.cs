/*
 * -fix the sword thing not on back **CHECK**
 * -fix the hitbox for the first enemy ** CHECK **
 * -fix the health bug **CHECK**
 * -make enemies spawn random spots **CHCEK**
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -add point system -- 1 pt per kill and bonus  points for each extra person on screen while enemy killed
 * -add instructions
 * -export to a website maybe? or just show video or give them downloadable if there are like NO bugs
 * 
 * 
 * point system explained:
 * so the AI script is for each AI, so the data isnt saved for the total amount of enemys killed. after each death it resets to zero
 * to fix this i might just make a different script altogether that takes the enemies spawned, enemys killed and calcualte points
